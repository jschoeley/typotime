\begin{abstract}
This technical paper describes the six demographic time scales age, period, birth cohort, death cohort, thanatological age and lifespan and their interrelations. It introduces definitions and technical terms necessary for a classification of the scales and their combinations. The aim of this work is to build up to the \enquote{unified model of demographic time} proposed by \cite{Riffe2015}, which unifies all 6 time scales in a single geometrical space.

\begin{description}
  \item[Demographic time scales] are measurements of time used in demography. We differentiate 6 time scales: Age, calender time, birth cohort, death cohort, thanatological age (time until death) and lifespan.
  \item[The Lexis diagram] is a Cartesian plane with calendar time on the abscissa and age on the ordinate. Cohort diagonals show the relation between age and period.
  \item[A temporal plane] is any $xy$ combination of 2 demographic time scales.
  \item[A temporal space] is any $xyz$ combination of 3 demographic time scales.
  \item[Given scales] are demographic time scales which are mapped to the main axis of a temporal plane or a temporal space (age and period in case of the Lexis diagram).
  \item[Derived scales] are demographic time scales which are calculated from the given scales (cohort in case of the Lexis diagram).
  \item[Lexis scales] are the three scales constituting the Lexis diagram: Age, calendar time and cohort.
  \item[Thanatological scales] are scales which take into account the end of life: Death cohort, time until death and lifespan.
  \item[An informative combination] is any combination of given scales which allows for the calculation of derived scales.
  \item[A non-informative combination] is any combination of given scales which does not allow for the calculation of derived scales.
